Problem Statement\n\nThe website currently has four separate service pages (website design, SEO optimization, website maintenance, and web hosting) located in the `/services/` directory, each with verbose content spanning 700-1100+ lines. This creates a fragmented user experience and excessive page length. Users need a single, consolidated services page with condensed, scannable content that provides an overview of all services without requiring navigation between multiple pages.\n\n## 2. User Story\n\n**As a** potential client visiting the Houston Web Services website,  \n**I want** to view all available services on a single, organized page,  \n**So that** I can quickly understand what services are offered without navigating between multiple pages and reading lengthy technical explanations.\n\n## 3. Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Happy Path\n- **GIVEN** a user visits `/services`, **WHEN** the page loads, **THEN** they see a hero section followed by four service sections (Website Design, SEO, Maintenance, Hosting) in a card/section-based layout\n- **GIVEN** a user views any service section, **WHEN** they read the content, **THEN** they see a concise description (2-3 sentences), key benefits (3-4 bullet points), and starting price\n- **GIVEN** a user wants more details, **WHEN** they click the \"Learn More\" or \"Get Started\" CTA on any service card, **THEN** they are directed to the contact page with the appropriate service pre-selected\n\n### Edge Cases\n- **GIVEN** a user has bookmarked an old URL like `/services/website-design`, **WHEN** they visit that URL, **THEN** they are redirected to `/services#website-design` anchor\n- **GIVEN** a user accesses the page on mobile, **WHEN** viewing service cards, **THEN** cards stack vertically with maintained visual hierarchy\n\n### Error Handling\n- **GIVEN** a search engine has indexed the old service pages, **WHEN** a crawler visits `/services/seo`, **THEN** it receives a 301 redirect to `/services#seo`\n\n## 4. Technical Context\n\n| Aspect | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Affected Files | `src/pages/services.astro` (modify), `src/pages/services/website-design.astro` (remove), `src/pages/services/seo.astro` (remove), `src/pages/services/maintenance.astro` (remove), `src/pages/services/hosting.astro` (remove) |\n| Dependencies | Existing components: `Layout.astro`, `HeroSection.astro`, `Button.astro`, `ContactCTA.astro`, `ServiceCard.astro` |\n| Constraints | Must maintain SEO value, keep page length reasonable (~500-700 lines max), preserve pricing section, ensure 301 redirects for old URLs |\n| Patterns to Follow | BEM CSS naming, mobile-first responsive design, design system CSS variables, existing component patterns |\n\n## 5. Non-Goals\n\n- **NOT** creating detailed individual service pages (content should be condensed only)\n- **NOT** changing the pricing packages section (this stays as-is in services.astro)\n- **NOT** modifying any components (using existing components only)\n- **NOT** adding new interactive features like accordions or tabs\n- **NOT** changing the contact form or process timeline sections\n\n## 6. Implementation Tasks\n\n```tasks\n## Phase 1: Foundation - Create Consolidated Services Content\n- [ ] T001: Create consolidated service data arrays with condensed content for all 4 services | File: src/pages/services.astro\n- [ ] T002: Add services overview grid section with service cards below existing \"What We Offer\" section | File: src/pages/services.astro\n\n## Phase 2: Integration - Build Service Detail Sections\n- [ ] T003: Create Website Design condensed section with anchor ID, benefits, and starting price | File: src/pages/services.astro\n- [ ] T004: Create SEO Optimization condensed section with anchor ID, benefits, and starting price | File: src/pages/services.astro\n- [ ] T005: Create Website Maintenance condensed section with anchor ID, benefits, and starting price | File: src/pages/services.astro\n- [ ] T006: Create Web Hosting condensed section with anchor ID, benefits, and starting price | File: src/pages/services.astro\n- [ ] T007: Add responsive CSS styles for new service detail sections | File: src/pages/services.astro\n\n## Phase 3: Cleanup & Redirects\n- [ ] T008: Create redirect stub pages for old service routes (website-design, seo, maintenance, hosting) | File: src/pages/services/\n- [ ] T009: Remove detailed content from individual service pages, replace with redirect meta tags | File: src/pages/services/website-design.astro\n- [ ] T010: Remove detailed content from SEO page, replace with redirect | File: src/pages/services/seo.astro\n- [ ] T011: Remove detailed content from Maintenance page, replace with redirect | File: src/pages/services/maintenance.astro\n- [ ] T012: Remove detailed content from Hosting page, replace with redirect | File: src/pages/services/hosting.astro\n- [ ] T013: Test build to ensure no broken imports or references | File: N/A\n```\n\n## 7. Success Metrics\n\n| Metric | Target |\n|--------|--------|\n| Page length (services.astro) | Under 800 lines total |\n| Service section word count | ~100-150 words per service |\n| Load time impact | No degradation from current |\n| All old URLs redirect properly | 100% redirect to anchors |\n| Mobile responsiveness | Full responsive layout works |\n| Build passes | Zero errors or warnings |\n\n## 8. Risks & Mitigations\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| Loss of SEO ranking from removing detailed pages | Implement proper 301 redirects with canonical URLs; condensed content still contains key terms |\n| Content too condensed to convey value | Include \"starting at\" prices and 3-4 key benefits per service to maintain value proposition |\n| Users expect separate service pages | Clear anchor navigation and visual separation between service sections |\n| Broken internal links | Search codebase for references to old service URLs and update them |\n\n---",
